# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to build an API for a social network where users would be able to share their thoughts, react to thoughts, and create a friend list.
I built this project to practice building an API using the popular language of MongoDB.
This solves the problem of not having enough practice using MongoDB.
